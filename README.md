# Starbucks Rewards Page
Starbucks Rewards Page Project by Front End Practice.
"Frontend Practice is a collection of real websites for developers to recreate as a way to improve and test their skills. We believe that a building from scratch approach will teach you a multitude of skills, including design, interactions, animations, troubleshooting, responsiveness, and more." 
This is a practice project and any and all materials owned by companies and individuals whose websites are featured on Frontend Practice are meant for practice purposes only. All rights goes to Starbucks.
